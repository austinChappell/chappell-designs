## Project Description

This is the code for my personal portfolio site.

### Things to know

This code is about 4 months old and is soon going to be refactored to run on NodeJS. The purpose of this is to transfer my blog over to the site.

This site is mostly a single page site. There is a 'getting started' page that acts as a contact page. Upon completion, the form is submitted via email using PHP.

A small amount of Javscript is used for this site, allowing certain elements to fade in, either upon the page load or upon scrolling into view.

Using some absolute positioning, the 'inner' div is placed over the image inside the 'outer' div. Upon hover, the text fades in with a dark overlay. These images are linked to other projects I have done.
